                    <h2>About DigitallyInked<span title="Welcome to DigitallyInked. Live Long and Prosper." class="fa fa-hand-spock-o"></span></h2>
                    <p>Hi. I’m <span class="highlight">Saptarshi Chakraborty</span>. This is <span class="highlight">DigitallyInked</span> – my personal website.</p>
                    <p>I am a Website Developer from Kolkata, India. My background is as a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering. I have worked on several projects from 2011 onwards and they are displayed here on this site.</p>
                    <p>My primary expertise is in Joomla and I make most of my websites using the Joomla CMS project. <span class="highlight"><a href="https://joomla.org" target="_blank">Joomla</a></span> is a highly popular Content Management System with over 2 million websites that have been made with it. I find Joomla to be a nice balance between the complexity of Drupal and the simplicity of WordPress. Joomla has all the tools that 90% of websites would need out of the box; and for that extra 10% there’s always thousands of extensions to choose from, or custom code. I usually make custom templates for my Joomla sites to give each site it’s own custom front-end.</p>
                    <p>If you need a website made, feel free to contact me about it. There’s no up-front cost to discussing your needs. Additionally, your website will be considered complete only when you are satisfied with it. All of this without breaking your bank.</p>
                    <p>Other than this, I am also trained in 3D Art and Animation, which I had learnt because I love video games and I wanted to get into game development. This never panned out, but I’m still glad that I learnt it. Over the years I have picked up the basics of Photo and Vector editing and also Video and Audio editing.</p>
                    <p>I’m also a bit of a Linux nerd and I have picked up how to manage a Linux system by using it for over 8 years for my own personal needs.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time, you will find me playing my favourite video games and sometimes even streaming it on Twitch.</p>
